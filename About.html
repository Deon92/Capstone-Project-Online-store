            <p id="AboutUsParagraph-1">
                Diagnosed with digestion in November of 2009, John Doe was forced to revisit his diet and
                make permanent changes to what he consumed. The Medical practicioner and Dietrician instructed
                John not to consume products that have been treated with certain pesticides and hormones.
            </p>
            <p id="AboutUsParagraph-2">
                John did research regarding the products sold at the supermarkets and he became aware that none
                of the supermarkets provided fresh uncontaminated products to their customers. John quickly realised
                that there was a gap in the market that needed to be addressed immediately. John grew up on a farm
                with his uncle and aunt. He reached out to his uncle and asked him for advise on where to start and
                what was needed to get this idea off the ground. John sold his car dealership and invested all of
                his money into buying a piece of land with all of the tools he would need to get started. John's
                uncle assisted Him in getting the farm going, "sowing, nurturing and ultimately harvesting".
            </p>

            <p id="AboutUsParagraph-3">
                Today, D&H Farmers Market is split into two 2000 acre farms serving around 500 retailer stores,
                including Pick & Pay, Checkers and Woolworths.
