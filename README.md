## Description of project <a name="introduction"></a> 
   In my bootcamp we were tasked to create an online store. My idea was to bring the
   shopping experience to the customer so that they can buy what they need from the
   comfort of their own homes. The main motivation behind this idea was that when lockdown
   hit I realised that South African businesses were not equiped to provide customers
   with the option of buying online and have the option of having their products delivered
   to their door.

### Product page
Once you have selected the “Products” tab, you will see the below page load. From here you can select whether you would like to buy Meat products, Dairy products, Vegetable products or Fruit products. If it happens that you would like to buy more than one different product, don’t fear, you will have the opportunity to choose a different type of product even after you have chosen a product type.

### Meat Product page
After you have made a choice, lets say for example you have chosen the Meat products, you can add any of the products displayed, in this case, meat products to your cart. You can do exactly the same on all the other product types.
